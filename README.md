# How to use (on chrome browser):
Step 1: Go to chrome://extensions and on the top right (for most people) it should have a Developer Mode toggle, turn that on. If it's already on, go to the next step.<br>
Step 2: Download the repository files at this link: https://github.com/ByteAfterlife/solvetodayswordle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and extract it to a folder.<br>
Step 3: Click the newly appearing "Load Unpacked" button and select the folder you just extracted. This folder should contain files like "manifest.json" and other things.<br>
Step 4: Done!<br>
# Note
Those instructions only work on chrome on computers. So you can't do that on a mobile phone or tablet.<br>
# How to do it on other browsers:
I don't really use another browser so idk, lookup "how to load unpacked extension on xxx browser"
